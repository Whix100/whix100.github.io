        <h2>Whix100</h2>
        <p>
            The name of my primary YouTube channel is Whix100 and I currently have over 2,400 subscribers. 
            I currently upload VODs of my Monday and Friday Twitch livestreams on my channel. 
            This channel is mostly a gaming channel but has some other content in it too. 
            Anything that I want to upload that doesn't belong on one of my other channels will be uploaded here.
        </p>
